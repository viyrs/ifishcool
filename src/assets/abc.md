# Generative Sketchpad

An experimental **real-time canvas** for exploring model-assisted drawing and interaction patterns.

## What it explores

- Mixing human sketching with generative AI
- Fast iteration loops on layout and composition
- Lightweight tooling that feels more like play than tooling

## Stack
